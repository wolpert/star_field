# Star Field

## Purpose

This project was started as a way to learn how to write games with Rust
using the ECS-style game engine Bevy.

## Building

You need to have rust installed, and core C development utilities like
`make` as well. Just run `make` on the command line to build the app
and run the un-optimized version of the app. 

### Development

Use `make dev` as your default build command as this will
* Run the tests
* Run the linter
* Run the application

## Gameplay

It's effectively an infinite runner style to be used on your phone with
abstract graphics. ('cause I cannot draw)
